# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It includes preprocessing, model training, and a deployed Streamlit app for predictions.

## Data-set
This project dataset is taken from kaggle(http://kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Streamlit App for Predictions
